In the world of computers and software, a Kubernetes pod is like a small, self-contained unit that holds one or more containers. Containers are like packages that include everything your software needs to run, such as the code, libraries, and settings.

Imagine a lunchbox with compartments. Each compartment can hold a different type of food â€“ a sandwich, a fruit, and a snack. In this analogy:

* The **lunchbox** is the Kubernetes pod.
    
* The **compartments** inside the lunchbox are the containers
    

So, a Kubernetes pod helps keep your software organized and makes sure the different parts of your application can work together effectively, just like the lunchbox keeps your meal items together for a tasty lunch!

## Now, Its time to write.

you can see it's pretty simple to write pod configuration.

## Finally, we will deploy to the cluster

$ kubectl get all ### **returns a list of pods, services, daemon sets, deployments, replica sets, jobs, cronjobs, and stateful sets ###**

$ kubectl apply -f pod.yaml ### Pod is created ###
